Title: Dione (moon)
Summary: Dione is the fourth largest moon of Saturn. It has a diameter of 1,123 km (698 miles). It was discovered in 1684 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. It is named after the titan Dione in Greek mythology. The moon has many craters and ice cliffs. It is tidally locked with Saturn, meaning the same face of Dione always faces Saturn.

Title: S/2003 J 12
Summary: is a moon of Jupiter, and is the smallest known. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003.

 is about 1 kilometre in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 17,740,000 km in 482.691 days, at an inclination of 143° to the ecliptic (143° to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.4449.

It is the closest of the farther non-spherical retrograde moons of Jupiter, and does not seem to belong to any group.

Title: Dia (moon)
Summary: Dia (S/2000 J 11) ls the second-outermost prograde non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000.

Dia is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 12,555,000 km in 287 days, at an inclination of 28° (to Jupiter's equator), and with an orbital eccentricity of 0.248.

The moon is included in the Himalia group. After discovery it was lost for ten years because the orbit was poorly known. Recovery allowed much better precision.
