Title: Phoebe (moon)
Summary: Phoebe is a moon which goes around (orbits) the planet called Saturn. It takes eighteen months for Phoebe to go all the way around Saturn. It is half made out of rock, and half made out of ice. The ground on Phoebe is black, which means that it is very dark when seen from Earth. Phoebe does not have any air, and there is no water on its surface.

There are many craters on Phoebe. These are from asteroids and other things crashing into it, and leaving round marks on the surface.

Phoebe is slightly irregular, which means that it is not perfectly round like a ball. It has an average diameter of 213 km. This means that the Earth's moon is 15 times bigger than Phoebe. The duration between two sunrises (rotation period) is only 9 hours and 16.5 minutes long.

Title: S/2003 J 12
Summary: is a moon of Jupiter, and is the smallest known. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003.

 is about 1 kilometre in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 17,740,000 km in 482.691 days, at an inclination of 143° to the ecliptic (143° to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.4449.

It is the closest of the farther non-spherical retrograde moons of Jupiter, and does not seem to belong to any group.

Summary: is a moon of Jupiter. A team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard et al. found it in 2004 in pictures taken in 2003.

 is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,740,000 km in 700.538 days, at an inclination of 149° to the ecliptic (149° to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.3931.

It belongs to the Pasiphaë group, non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000 km, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5° and 158.3°.

Title: Dia (moon)
Summary: Dia (S/2000 J 11) ls the second-outermost prograde non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000.

Dia is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 12,555,000 km in 287 days, at an inclination of 28° (to Jupiter's equator), and with an orbital eccentricity of 0.248.

The moon is included in the Himalia group. After discovery it was lost for ten years because the orbit was poorly known. Recovery allowed much better precision.

Title: Dione (moon)
Summary: Dione is the fourth largest moon of Saturn. It has a diameter of 1,123 km (698 miles). It was discovered in 1684 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. It is named after the titan Dione in Greek mythology. The moon has many craters and ice cliffs. It is tidally locked with Saturn, meaning the same face of Dione always faces Saturn.

Question: How big is the earth's moon?
tokens used to preform search205
------------------------------------------------------------
The Earth's moon is 15 times bigger than Phoebe, which has an average diameter of 213 km. To find the diameter of the Earth's moon, we can multiply Phoebe's diameter by 15:

\( 213 \text{ km} \times 15 = 3195 \text{ km} \)

Thus, the average diameter of the Earth's moon is approximately 3,195 km.
